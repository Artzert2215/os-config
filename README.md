⚠️  Alert: Just started, so very much not working! ⚠️

# Quickstart

Run the deploy script in a terminal of a freshly installed system:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoderDojoRotselaar/os-config/master/deploy.sh > /tmp/deploy.sh
sudo -E bash /tmp/deploy.sh
```

Note: this script will run as root and WILL change your system! It may delete your pictures, upload your private live and perhaps eat your children too... I suggest reviewing the content of this script before actually running it. Or run it, as suggested, on a clean, freshly installed system.

# Supported operating systems

* Linux Lite (<https://www.linuxliteos.com/>)
* Endless OS (<https://endlessos.com/>)
* Fedora (<https://fedoraproject.org/>)
